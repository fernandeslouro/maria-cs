# Simple C# Projects

For fun, I decided to do the assignments of an Intro to Programming course my girlfriend Maria attended at Copenhagen Business School.

The class was taught using C#, which was new to me. This repo includes two "midterm" projects (first and second) and a final project (third). The three projects are terminal applications, and the PDF files inside each of the folders describe the requirements for each assignment.
